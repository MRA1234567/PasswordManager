# PasswordManager
The project is a SPA password manager
It allows for a user to create a account and login, then having 3 password folders to edit. Allowing the user to enter the Account name, Username, Email and password for the account of their choice.
Giving the user the ability to add all the information they need for their accounts so they will no longer need to remember it.

The password manager can be used by people that have many accounts and struggle to remember the login details for all of them or having either weak or the same password for all of their accounts.
Having a weak password or using the same password for all accounts can be a great security risk.
A weak password allows for attackers to easily brute force the users password. Using the same password for many accounts means that if attackers find out one password then they are able to access all of the users accounts.

The password manager first rpesents the user with a login form where the user must enter a username and password to access their password folders.
If the user has no login then they can enter the sign up form where they enter a username and password to create a login.
Once the user has logged in they are presented with a page where they can edit the password folders, choosing which to edit with a dropdown.
The user can then enter a Account name, Username, Email and password for each password folder.
